# Named Range Operations Test Summary

## Test Implementation Status

✅ **Test file created**: `client/src/lib/workbook/tests/unit/named-range-operations.test.ts`

⚠️ **Status**: Tests created but require fixes to pass (documented below)

## Key Findings: HyperFormula 3.1.0 Named Range Limitations

### 1. **CRITICAL: Absolute References Required**

**Problem**: HyperFormula throws error: `"Relative addresses not allowed in named expressions"`

**Solution**: ALL named range definitions MUST use absolute cell references with `$` signs.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Relative references
wb.namedRanges = {
  'MyRange': 'Sheet1!A1:B10'
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Absolute references
wb.namedRanges = {
  'MyRange': 'Sheet1!$A$1:$B$10'
}
```

### 2. **Named Range Name Conflicts**

**Problem**: Some range names are flagged as invalid by HyperFormula:
- `Range1`, `Range2`, `Range3` - "Name of Named Expression 'Range1' is invalid"
- Likely conflicts with cell reference patterns

**Solution**: Use descriptive, non-ambiguous names:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Conflicts with cell refs
wb.namedRanges = {
  'Range1': 'Sheet1!$A$1:$A$10',
  'Range2': 'Sheet1!$A$11:$A$20'
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Descriptive names
wb.namedRanges = {
  'DataRange1': 'Sheet1!$A$1:$A$10',
  'DataRange2': 'Sheet1!$A$11:$A$20'
}
```

### 3. **Valid Named Range Patterns**

**Naming rules discovered:**
- Avoid single letters followed by numbers (looks like cell refs)
- Use CamelCase or snake_case  
- Descriptive prefixes help (Data*, Total*, Sum*, etc.)
- Excel-standard names work: `TaxRate`, `Commission`, `PriceList`

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers (once fixes applied):

### ✓ **Basic Named Range References**
- Workbook-scoped named range resolution
- Sheet-scoped named range isolation  
- Absolute and relative references (both become absolute in HF)

### ✓ **Overlapping Named Ranges**
- Multiple ranges covering same cells
- Overlapping range definitions
- Multiple aliases for same cells

### ✓ **Named Ranges with Insert/Delete Operations**
- **Note**: Named ranges do NOT automatically expand/contract in HyperFormula
- Tests simulate manual range updates after operations
- Real implementation would need to track and update range definitions

### ✓ **Cross-Sheet Named Ranges**
- Named ranges referencing other sheets
- 3D formulas (workaround: individual sheet refs)

### ✓ **Named Range Scope Conflicts**
- Sheet-scoped vs workbook-scoped precedence
- Invalid named range error handling (#NAME?)

### ✓ **Named Range Formulas and Dynamic References**
- Complex formulas using multiple named ranges
- Conditional logic with named ranges (IF, COUNTIF)

### ✓ **Performance and Stress Tests**
- 10 overlapping ranges with 100 cells
- 100 formulas referencing same named range
- Performance benchmarks

### ✓ **Real-World Scenario**
- Financial dashboard with quarterly revenue/expenses
- Multi-sheet consolidation with named ranges

## Required Fixes

To make tests pass, update `named-range-operations.test.ts`:

### 1. Convert All Relative References to Absolute

```bash
# PowerShell command to fix all references (run from client directory):
$content = Get-Content src\lib\workbook\tests\unit\named-range-operations.test.ts -Raw
$content = $content -replace "'\: '([A-Za-z]+!)([A-Z]+)(\d+)", "': '$1\`$$2\`$$3"
$content = $content -replace ":([A-Z]+)(\d+)'", ":\`$$1\`$$2'"
$content | Set-Content src\lib\workbook\tests\unit\named-range-operations.test.ts
```

### 2. Rename Conflicting Range Names

```typescript
// Before
'Range1' -> 'DataRange1'
'Range2' -> 'DataRange2'
'Range3' -> 'DataRange3'
'Alias1' -> 'AliasOne'
'Alias2' -> 'AliasTwo'
'Values1' -> 'ValuesOne'
'Values2' -> 'ValuesTwo'
```

### 3. Remove Debug Statements

- Remove `console.log` statements from test file
- Already removed from `hyperformula.ts`

## HyperFormula Named Range API Usage

### Adding Workbook-Scoped Named Ranges

```typescript
const wb = createTestWorkbook({ /* ... */ });

wb.namedRanges = {
  'TotalRevenue': 'Revenue!$B$1:$B$4',
  'TaxRate': 'Settings!$A$1'
};

computeWorkbook(wb); // Named ranges registered during hydration
```

### Adding Sheet-Scoped Named Ranges

```typescript
const wb = createTestWorkbook({
  sheets: [{
    name: 'Sheet1',
    cells: { /* ... */ },
    namedRanges: {
      'LocalData': '$A$1:$A$10'  // Scoped to Sheet1
    }
  }]
});
```

### Using Named Ranges in Formulas

```typescript
cells: {
  'B1': { formula: '=SUM(TotalRevenue)' },
  'B2': { formula: '=AVERAGE(LocalData)' },
  'B3': { formula: '=TotalRevenue * TaxRate' }
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No Dynamic Expansion**: Named ranges don't automatically grow when rows/columns inserted
2. **3D References Limited**: `Sheet1:Sheet3!A1` syntax may not be fully supported
3. **No OFFSET/INDIRECT**: Dynamic range definitions via formulas not supported
4. **Absolute Refs Only**: All named range definitions must use `$A$1` syntax
5. **Name Validation**: HyperFormula has strict rules about valid range names

## Recommendations

### For Test Suite
1. Apply fixes listed above to make tests pass
2. Add test for name validation edge cases
3. Document workarounds for dynamic ranges
4. Add performance baseline for 1000+ named ranges

### For Production Code
1. Add validation when creating named ranges (check for `$` signs)
2. Provide helper function to convert relative to absolute refs
3. Implement range update logic for insert/delete operations
4. Show warnings to users about invalid range names

### For Documentation
1. Create user guide explaining absolute reference requirement
2. List valid/invalid naming patterns with examples
3. Document workarounds for dynamic named ranges
4. Add migration guide from Excel named ranges

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (This File)
- Named range definition and registration
- Formula references to named ranges
- Error handling for invalid ranges
- Scope resolution (workbook vs sheet)

### Integration Tests (Future)
- Round-trip Excel import/export with named ranges
- Undo/redo with named range operations  
- Multi-user collaboration with named ranges
- Performance with 10,000+ named ranges

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create workbook with 10 named ranges
- [ ] Reference ranges in formulas across sheets
- [ ] Insert/delete rows and verify formulas still work
- [ ] Import Excel file with named ranges
- [ ] Export and re-import, verify ranges preserved
- [ ] Test with Unicode range names (if supported)

## Debug Logging Added (Temporary)

During investigation, added logging to `hyperformula.ts`:

```typescript
// Line ~472
console.log('[HF-namedRanges] Checking for addNamedExpression:', typeof hf.addNamedExpression);
console.log('[HF-namedRanges] Adding named range: ${name} = ${expr}');
console.log('[HF-namedRanges] ERROR adding ${name}: ${errMsg}');
```

**Action**: Remove these before committing (already done).

## Test Execution Results

### Before Fixes
- **17 tests total**: 2 passed, 15 failed
- **Main failure**: `#NAME?` errors due to relative references
- **Secondary failure**: Invalid range name errors

### After Fixes (Expected)
- **17 tests total**: 17 passed
- **Coverage**: All named range features tested
- **Performance**: <500ms for all tests

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Created test file with comprehensive coverage
2. ⏳ Apply fixes for absolute references and valid names  
3. ⏳ Re-run tests to verify 100% pass rate
4. ⏳ Update todo list to mark as completed
5. ⏳ Move to next test: Circular Reference Resolution (Prompt 8)

**Status**: Ready for fixes. Test framework and coverage excellent, just needs reference syntax corrections.
