Performance investigation: `formula-dependencies.test.ts`

This note explains how to reproduce and collect timing data for the failing perf test:

Target test
- File: client/src/lib/workbook/formula-dependencies.test.ts
- Test title: "Performance and Stress Tests > should handle large dependency chain efficiently"

What we added
- The test now logs two concise metric lines when running:
  - HEAVY_OP_MS compute:<ms>
  - HEAVY_OP_MS update:<ms>

These are easy to parse from the Vitest stdout logs.

Reproduce (PowerShell)

Open PowerShell in the repo root and run:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\jayve\projects\nexcell\client

# Run the single test 10 times, saving logs per run
for ($i=1; $i -le 10; $i++) {
  Write-Host "Run #$i"
  pnpm test -- src/lib/workbook/formula-dependencies.test.ts -- -t "Performance and Stress Tests > should handle large dependency chain efficiently" --reporter verbose | Tee-Object -FilePath ".\tmp\perf-run-$i.log"
}

# Grep the HEAVY_OP_MS lines to produce a summary
Get-ChildItem .\tmp\perf-run-*.log | ForEach-Object {
  $content = Get-Content $_.FullName
  $compute = $content | Select-String -Pattern "HEAVY_OP_MS compute:([0-9]+)" | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches[0].Groups[1].Value }
  $update = $content | Select-String -Pattern "HEAVY_OP_MS update:([0-9]+)" | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches[0].Groups[1].Value }
  [PSCustomObject]@{
    File = $_.Name
    ComputeMs = ($compute -as [int])
    UpdateMs = ($update -as [int])
  }
} | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

Parsing notes
- If the compute/update lines don't appear, run the whole file without the -t filter (Vitest sometimes has matching quirks). The metric lines are printed by the test itself.
- Calculate median and variance across runs to see flakiness.

Next steps based on results
- If metric is stable and > threshold: profile with Node CPU profiler (see below) and open the profile in Chrome DevTools to find hot functions.
- If metric is flaky: adapt test to median-of-N inside the test or relax the threshold temporarily while we profile.

Quick profiling (if compute step looks slow)

```powershell
# Generate CPU profile via Node
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--cpu-prof --cpu-prof-name=vitest-profile"
pnpm test -- src/lib/workbook/formula-dependencies.test.ts -- -t "Performance and Stress Tests > should handle large dependency chain efficiently"

# This produces a v8 CPU profile file in the working directory. Use node --prof-process or Chrome DevTools to inspect.
```

If you want me to run the 10Ã— loop and collect the summary in this environment, say so and I'll execute it and report the median, min, max, and suggest the next action (profile vs test relaxation).
