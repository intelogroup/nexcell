## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic approach**: Breaking down into granular subtasks
2. **TypeScript strictness**: Caught bugs early
3. **Documentation-first**: Created clear context for next dev
4. **Testing mindset**: Planned testing strategy upfront

### What to Improve
1. **Write tests first**: TDD would have caught API bugs earlier
2. **Continuous integration**: Should have been set up from day 1
3. **Error handling**: Should be built into base components
4. **Type generation**: Consider OpenAPI ‚Üí TypeScript codegen

### Recommendations for Next Developer
1. Read QUICK_START.md before making changes
2. Check EXPERT_REVIEW_REPORT.md for context
3. Follow existing patterns (Zustand stores, React Query)
4. Add tests for new features (don't skip!)
5. Update docs when adding major features

**Status**: ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete  
**Next Sprint**: Error Handling + Testing  
**Blocked By**: None  
**Risk Level**: Low (core functionality stable)
