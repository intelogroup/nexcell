# Act Mode Execution Fix

## Issues Found

### 1. **Sheet Operations Not Executed**
When AI generated `addSheet` action, it was being ignored because `convertToWorkbookActions()` only handles cell operations, not sheet management operations.

### 2. **Unlimited Conversation History**
All messages were being sent to AI, potentially causing:
- Token limit issues with long conversations
- Loss of focus on recent context
- Higher API costs

### 3. **Plan Mode Check Timing**
The plan mode check was happening after conversion, so sheet operations weren't being blocked properly in plan mode.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Added Sheet Operation Handling**
Added explicit handling for sheet operations BEFORE cell operations:

```typescript
// Handle sheet operations (addSheet, deleteSheet, renameSheet)
for (const action of actions) {
  if (action.type === 'addSheet') {
    const newSheet = addNewSheet(action.sheetName);
    console.log('[AI-Workbook] Created new sheet:', newSheet.name);
  } else if (action.type === 'deleteSheet') {
    if (action.sheetName) {
      const sheet = workbook.sheets.find(s => s.name === action.sheetName);
      if (sheet) {
        deleteSheetById(sheet.id);
        console.log('[AI-Workbook] Deleted sheet:', action.sheetName);
      }
    }
  } else if (action.type === 'renameSheet') {
    if (action.oldName && action.newName) {
      const sheet = workbook.sheets.find(s => s.name === action.oldName);
      if (sheet) {
        renameSheet(sheet.id, action.newName);
        console.log('[AI-Workbook] Renamed sheet:', action.oldName, '->', action.newName);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Limited Conversation History to Last 10 Messages**
```typescript
// Build conversation history from latest messages snapshot (last 10 for context)
const conversationHistory = (() => {
  const allMessages = messages.map(m => ({ role: m.role, content: m.content }));
  // Keep last 10 messages for context (better token efficiency and focused context)
  return allMessages.slice(-10);
})();
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced token usage (lower costs)
- More focused AI responses based on recent context
- Prevents context window overflow on long conversations
- Faster API responses

### 3. **Moved Plan Mode Check Earlier**
Now blocks ALL operations (both sheet and cell) in plan mode BEFORE execution:

```typescript
// Check if we're in plan mode - block ALL execution (including sheet operations)
if (currentChatMode === 'plan') {
  console.log('[AI-Workbook] ⚠️ Operations blocked: Chat is in PLAN mode');
  const planBlockedMessage: Message = {
    id: (Date.now() + 2).toString(),
    role: 'system',
    content: `⚠️ Plan mode is active - operations were NOT executed.\n\n` +
      `The AI identified ${actions.length} action(s) but they were blocked:\n` +
      actions.map(a => `• ${a.type}: ${a.sheetName || a.target || a.range || 'operation'}`).join('\n') +
      `\n\nSwitch to ACT mode to execute these changes.`,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  };
  setMessages((prev) => [...prev, planBlockedMessage]);
  return; // Exit early, don't execute
}
```

## Supported Sheet Operations

### `addSheet`
```json
{
  "type": "addSheet",
  "sheetName": "Budget"
}
```

### `deleteSheet`
```json
{
  "type": "deleteSheet",
  "sheetName": "OldSheet"
}
```

### `renameSheet`
```json
{
  "type": "renameSheet",
  "oldName": "Sheet1",
  "newName": "Data"
}
```

## Files Modified
- `client/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`
  - Added sheet operation handlers
  - Limited conversation history to 10 messages
  - Moved plan mode check earlier
  - Added dependencies: `addNewSheet`, `renameSheet`, `deleteSheetById`

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Add Sheet in Act Mode
1. Switch to **Act mode**
2. Send: "create a new sheet called Budget"
3. Expected: New sheet "Budget" is created
4. Verify: Sheet tab appears at bottom

### Test Scenario 2: Add Sheet in Plan Mode  
1. Switch to **Plan mode**
2. Send: "create a new sheet called Budget"
3. Expected: Operation is blocked with warning message
4. Verify: No new sheet is created

### Test Scenario 3: Multiple Operations
1. Switch to **Act mode**
2. Send: "create a Budget sheet and set A1 to Income"
3. Expected: 
   - New sheet "Budget" is created
   - Cell A1 is set to "Income"
4. Verify: Both operations execute

### Test Scenario 4: Long Conversation Context
1. Have 20+ messages in conversation
2. Send a command
3. Expected: Only last 10 messages sent to AI
4. Verify: Check console logs for conversation history length

## Known Issues

- **TypeScript Warning**: Line 473 shows false positive about type comparison - this is a closure/async context issue and doesn't affect runtime behavior
- **AI May Still Discuss Instead of Act**: GPT-4 might respond conversationally even in act mode. This is model behavior, not a bug in the code. May need to adjust system prompts further.

## Next Steps

1. Test with real user commands in Act mode
2. Monitor if GPT-4 generates JSON actions consistently
3. If GPT-4 continues discussing instead of acting, adjust system prompt to be more directive
4. Consider adding explicit "execute now" command for clarity
